We don't have tests yet, but here is a log of functions we want to have tests for:

graphics.Canvas.get_{static,agent}_id_and_increment
- Is the number increasing correctly?
graphics.Canvas.set_lane_width
- What happens when we set different lane widths? Does it complain? (It should)
graphics.Canvas.transform_{x,y}{,_inv}
- need examples

wm2.Car.which_regions
- should be empty when agent not in allowed_regions
- different combinations of filter_fn?
wm2.Car.lane_boundaries
- need examples with x/y and non x/y Direction2D
wm2.Car.minimal_stopping_distance{,_from_max_v}
- need examples
wm2.Car.closest_{agent,stop_region,intersection}_forward
- need examples
wm2.any_agents_in_intersection
- need examples
wm2.Car.aggresive_driving (straight for now)
wm2.Car.step
