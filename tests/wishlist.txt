We don't have tests yet, but here is a log of functions we want to have tests for:

tools.pyglet.Canvas.get_{static,agent}_id_and_increment
- Is the number increasing correctly?
tools.pyglet.Canvas.set_lane_width
- What happens when we set different lane widths? Does it complain? (It should)
tools.pyglet.Canvas.transform_{x,y}{,_inv}
- need examples

tools.design.Car.which_regions
- should be empty when agent not in allowed_regions
- different combinations of filter_fn?
tools.design.Car.lane_boundaries
- need examples with x/y and non x/y Direction2D
tools.design.Car.minimal_stopping_distance{,_from_max_v}
- need examples
tools.design.Car.closest_{agent,stop_region,intersection}_forward
- need examples
tools.design.any_agents_in_intersection
- need examples
tools.design.Car.aggresive_driving (straight for now)
tools.design.Car.step

tools.design.Environment.{agents_unfrozen,agents_freeze*,agents_unfreeze*}
tools.design.Environment.state
- check dtype of entire array is correct
tools.design.Enviroment.{step,reset,render}
- unknown how?

tools.misc.ltl.Parser
- other ltl properties: F, G, X, not, (...)
